Fresh Debian Install Setup
==========================

This repository contains the scripts and Ansible tasks that automates all the things I do after a fresh Debian installation, such as configuration, packages, desktop look and feel and others.

It is tested on Debian Stretch (my current version) and XFCE as desktop environment.
